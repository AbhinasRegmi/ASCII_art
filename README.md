# ASCII_art
This is a program that convert a image input to text file that has ascii character instead of image pixels.
You need to pass a bmp image with name "image" of course you can change that in code.
Avoid using large images as input because when you create large files it will be difficult to observe patterns as you will have to zoom out a lot.
there is a problem in the programm the output inverts the image upside down so it is better to give upside down image as input
